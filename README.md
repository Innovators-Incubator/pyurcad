# pyurcad
Pure (Python) CAD requires only python3 and the python standard libraries.
This is a rewrite of Cadvas version 0.5.2 but is not built on the AppShell
framework (and Python Mega Widgets).
I got the inspiration to do this when I discovered an example of how to do
3D graphics with Tkinter in Bhaskar Chaudhary's recent book:
"Tkinter GUI Application Development Blueprints - Second Edition". Frankly,
I was really surprised to see 3D on the tkinter canvas. This got me excited.
In this book, he also presents a framework on which he builds a "Paint" app
with a simple, clean and functional interface that seems like it should
work fine for my CAD app. So, after a couple of days of effort, here it is.
I even renamed it PYurCAD (pronounced PureCAD).

Unfortunately, some stuff still isn't working right. I guess it's a work in
progress, like everything. The cool thing is that there are no barriers for
anyone to download (or clone) this repository and launch the app. All you 
need is Python3. No additional libraries. Just run the file pyurcad.py.
